- [x] Implement the `arnoldi` solver for primal algorithms
- [ ] Implement the primal algorithm to fit RRR without tikhonov reg.
- [ ] Add the possibility to compute left eigenvectors for the primal algorithms.
- [x] Implement the prediction algorithm for the primal problem
- [ ] Incapsulate every algorithm into `sklearn` estimators with proper checks etc
- [x] Implement methods to compute the `svd` for both primal and dual algorithms
- [ ] Implement the following metrics:
    - [ ] Squared loss
    - [ ] Prediction error
- [ ] Add tests for each of the algorithm
    - [ ] Primal and dual should give the same results on the same data (e.g. linear kernel)
- [ ] Implement fit_rand_tikhonov in primal.py
- [ ] Complete eigfun in DirectEstimators.py (what is phi_testX? should we apply a feature map? If so, isn't it something at the general class level?)
